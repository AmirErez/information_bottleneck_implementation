Single Cell Data compressions
============================
An implementation of Chigirev and Bialek 2003

Purpose
-------

This repository is a simple implementation of a data compression algorithm first established by Chigirev and Bialek in NIPs (2003).  I find this method valueable for its ability to compress data, while preserving nonlinear relationships between observable coordinates.  My hope is that this technique can be used for preprocessing single cell cytometry data (e.g. Flow cytometry, Mass cytometry), and consequently, enabling practitioners to define biological populations more robustly.
